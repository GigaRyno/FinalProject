# FinalProject
Final Project for CSI-230

- Made the main frame for the project 
- having a hard time finding a good graph library
- Added test.csv file to be able to get it on my VM and to test with real data
- Added graph_utils.cpp & graph_utils.h to be able to parse through the CSV file
- started to add the options for when calling the code (my goal was to have the person select which option they wanted to look at by passing in the option)
-
