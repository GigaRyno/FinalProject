# FinalProject
Final Project for CSI-230

- Made the main frame for the project 
- having a hard time finding a good graph library
- Added test.csv file to be able to get it on my VM and to test with real data
- Added graph_utils.cpp & graph_utils.h to be able to parse through the CSV file
- started to add arguments in  and starting to link them to the CSV processing
- Added 2 arguments to call (RPM & Boost for now) I hope to add more when I get the graph going. Trying to size it back for now till I get it working flawlessly then I will add more
