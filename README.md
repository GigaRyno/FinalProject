# FinalProject
Final Project for CSI-230

- Made the main frame for the project 
- having a hard time finding a good graph library
- Added test.csv file to be able to get it on my VM and to test with real data
- Adding checks for arguments
- Added graph_utils.cpp & graph_utils.h to be able to parse through the CSV file
- started to add arguments in  and starting to link them to the CSV processing
- Added 2 arguments to call (RPM & Boost for now) I hope to add more when I get the graph going. Trying to size it back for now till I get it working flawlessly then I will add more
- Added pbPlots which is a c++ library that makes making graphs easy
- I had issues havign processCSV in the other graph_utils.cpp so I brought it back over to the main.cpp file and also put the PrintVector function into the graph_utils.
- Updated all nessecery files
